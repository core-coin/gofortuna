   package fortuna implements the Fortuna PRNG designed by Niels
   Ferguson, Bruce Schneier, and Yadayoshi Kohno. The PRNG is
   described in the book _Cryptography Engineering_, by the same
   authors (see pages 142-160). This implementation uses AES-256
   and as the underlying PRF and SHA-256 as the underlying PRG.
